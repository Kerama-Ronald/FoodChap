# FoodChap RESTFul API
Created using flask, sqlAlchemy orm and sqlite database.

## Setup
First you need to install packages required to run this project using `pip`. A requirements.txt file
has been provided and I hope it will be updated. To install the packages needed, simply run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next to run the flask app run:

## Linux
```bash
python3 api/app.py
```
## Windows
```bash
python api/app.py
```
or

```bash
py api/app.py
```
